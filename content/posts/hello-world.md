title: Hello World!

As is customary in the programming world, you're first entry into the world of a new language or technology is the good old "Hello World" program. Taking this into account I thought that there would be no better title to a first post than "Hello World!"

So here goes...

We can try HTML, where we do 

    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

Save the file under whatever name you choose, open it in your browser and there it is, **Hello World!**, in big ugly black letters.

Or maybe we can try Python, where we write 

    print("Hello World!")

Wow, run the _.py_ file and magically "Hello World!" will appear in the console. This all might seem a bit boring, especially to all the seasoned developers out there, but there is nothing as exciting as seeing that insignificant output after writing your first little program. 

That insignificant little program often paves the way to far more bigger, better and, more often than not, much more complicated programs. That "Hello World" is the first step on the journey to become a developer. 

So, am I developer? That is a difficult question. To be honest, I don't feel like one. I am one of the lucky ones who decided at the ripe age of 40 to make a career change and pursue a career in software development. 

I've been studying, doing tutorials, building small projects and I even got a freelance contract to some, albeit very basic, front end development. In the two years since I made the decision to change careers, I have tried to learn as much as I could, but I still don't feel like a proper developer.

Will I feel like a proper developer if I get a job as one? Will I feel like a proper developer if I build bigger, more complicated applications which solve a real world problem? I don't know and I'm not so sure. 

I guess it is the so-called "imposter syndrome", but I'm slowly starting to realize that to try and know everything is an impossibility. I'm starting to realize that, yes, you will Google a lot. Yes, you will spend a fair amount of time on Stackoverflow trying to figure out what you're doing wrong. I'm making peace with the fact that that is normal.

So here I am. I'm still learning, still building things, still trying to figure things out, but I'm enjoying every minute of it.
